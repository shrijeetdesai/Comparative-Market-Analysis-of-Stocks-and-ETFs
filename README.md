# Comparative-Market-Analysis-of-Stocks-and-ETFs

This project presents a comprehensive dashboard for analyzing the performance of selected stocks and ETFs over time. Using data from Yahoo Finance, I have visualized various metrics to compare trends, volatility, trading volumes, and returns across multiple assets. The dashboard was created using Apache Superset, enabling users to interactively explore market trends and performance indicators.
